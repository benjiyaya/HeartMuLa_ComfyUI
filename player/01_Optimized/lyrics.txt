[Verse 1]
Sunshine on the hilltop
Birds are singing their song
Every step I take now
Feels like where I belong

[Chorus]
Rise up with the morning
Let your spirit fly
Dreams are waiting for you
Underneath the sky

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Rivers flow so gently
Through the meadows green
Nature paints her pictures
Most beautiful I have seen

[Chorus]
Rise up with the morning
Let your spirit fly
